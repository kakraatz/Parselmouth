## Getting started

This guide is intended to be general and basic in its design. This guide is to be used as a first stepping stone by new contributors to the project. Always communicate directly with the project owners if more thorough instructions are needed or if you have a question that is not covered here.

An introduction and overview of the project can be found in the [README](README.md). Before continuing further, it is suggested that you first read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

For more information about open source contributing, check out [this article](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Reporting issues and bugs

If you come across an issue or a bug in the project, including documentation errors, please help out by bringing the problem to the project's attention.

### Search through existing issues

Before going further, ensure that the issue or bug you are reporting does not already exist by scanning through the active [issues](https://github.com/YannickJadoul/Parselmouth/issues). This is also a good starting point to discovering something you would like to work on for the project.

### Open a new issue for review

As a good rule of thumb, it is encouraged that if you have multiple issues to create, that you do not include them all in one single issue creation. In other words - for *each* bug or issue you have, you should open *one* issue for review.

When creating a new issue, include steps to reproduce what you encountered if possible. Include as much descriptive information about the issue as succinctly as you can. Screenshots and example projects also help a lot here to demonstrate issues.

## Making a contribution

Before starting work on a contribution for the project, communicate with the other developers about what you aim to add or fix, and come up with a plan collaboratively. This will ensure that your ideas are not unnecessary or unneeded.

- First, confirm that you have the appropriate development environment setup for creating your changes.
- Fork the repository to your GitHub. Read about [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) if needed.
- Start working on your contribution. Make sure you fully *comment* your code, and *commit* your changes, before making a pull request.

When you are satisfied with whatever code or changes you have produced, you should go ahead and create a pull request.

### Pull Requests

When you are ready to add your work to the main project repository, you can create a pull request to merge your forked version with the original.

You can learn about making pull requests from forks [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Once you have completed your pull request, it will be reviewed by a project developer/reviewer to ensure your contribution is appropriate.

If you are making a contribution based on an issue located in the issues log, make sure that the issue gets closed upon a successful pull request merge.
